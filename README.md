# Monitor-Server V0.1
Monitor-Server of SmartCar, using RVIZ to conduct visualization.

### Feature
> 1. using protobuf to serialization
> 2. using twisted-python to conduct async function
> 3. multi-monitor of vehicles is supported
> 4. using rviz to conduct visualization function, both 2D/3D

### TODO
1. Currently, only the monitor of current-pose has been finished.  
2. Multi-monitor of vehicles is supported but never tested.  
3. The effects of visualization should be promoted.

### Attention:
This has been dispatched for some reason, although there is still much work to do.  
At version 0.2, we will use new data-protocol.
